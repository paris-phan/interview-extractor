  "COLD_OPEN": "Yeah, my journey really kicked off after my family and I moved to the States from the Philippines. That move sparked this drive in me to chase the American dream, leading me to enlist in the Marines. Serving the country opened up the world to me, literally. I deployed a few times, got to lead, and saw places I'd only dreamed of. But after my service, I felt this gap in my education. So, I looked into UVA, aiming to achieve what I hadn't right out of high school. That's where my shift into finance came in. It was entirely new to me and my family, but I was drawn to the curiosity and excitement of exploring something unknown.",
  "TURNING_POINT": "One of the biggest hurdles I faced was during a mission with the Romanian Navy. Our task was to train, aid, and assist before their combat deployment, but they had a different idea of what they wanted to achieve. The challenge was not only the language barrier but also bridging our differing expectations of the mission. It was tense, and making everyone comfortable with our agenda required some quick thinking. We found a translator to overcome the language issue, and to address the cultural differences, I negotiated with them: focus during training, and I'd treat them to beers afterward. This experience taught me the importance of relationship management and adapting to unexpected situations.",
  "STEAL_THIS": "The question that's stuck with me is, 'Tell me about your soul.' It's profound and requires deep reflection. It was asked during a job interview and then again at a friend's funeral. Both times, it made me deeply contemplate who I am, what I value, and why I do what I do. It's a transformative question that goes beyond surface-level interactions, inviting a genuine understanding of a person's core.",
  "BUYER_BEWARE": "",
  "INDUSTRY_INSIDER": "People often appreciate my service as a Marine, but there's a misconception that it's all about overt patriotism. While I am patriotic, conversations can get tense due to preconceived notions about military service. Another misunderstanding is the range of experiences I bring to the table. Until I share my stories, it's not immediately apparent to others, especially younger students, that I've led adults into foreign countries and been responsible for their lives. These experiences are far removed from the typical college student's life, and it's something I feel is often overlooked.",
  "IF_I_WERE_YOU": "I believe everyone should view university as a level playing field. The resources, professors, and courses are there for you, but it's on you to make the most of them. If you're aiming for a goal, like breaking into finance or consulting, remember it's not mandatory to join specific clubs. Instead, focus on leveraging your strengths to uncover new opportunities. My advice is to set tangible goals, put yourself out there, and importantly, don't compare your journey to others'. Everyone's path is unique, and it's all about how you navigate yours that matters."
