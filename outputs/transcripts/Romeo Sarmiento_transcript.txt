So, you've had a pretty expansive career. You started off in the Marines and then moved on to work in the, going to UVA and working in the finance industry while also staying very connected to your communities that you've been a part of. I'd love to hear in your own words, how'd you get your start? Yeah, I mean, I think I'll go back to the person I, you know, eventually evolved into after my family and I moved here from the Philippines and that created a mindset of trying to achieve this American dream. And I think that prompted me to enlist into the Marines and serve the country that, you know, afforded us this great opportunity. And then from there, you know, I deployed a few times, I saw the world on multiple occasions and I had the chance to lead. And so coming back to the States after some deployments, I had to reevaluate, you know, where I was in relation to, you know, the world and the people around me. And one of the, one of the things that I was missing while I was in the Marine Corps was the education part. So shopped around a bit and then because I'm a Virginian, I looked to UVA as an opportunity for me to, you know, achieve something that I couldn't necessarily achieve coming right out of high school. So that's really what I would consider my start, you know, going from the military into college. And then, you know, trying to draw back that mindset of pursuing something greater, something that's new. None of my family members were in the financial sector or anywhere adjacent to that field. And so exploring finance as an opportunity was a way for me to trailblaze something new and it brought a lot of curiosity and excitement to what I was pursuing at the time. Does that answer your question? Yeah. Yeah. That definitely answers my question. What's a challenge that you faced at any point in your career? Yeah, that's, let's see. I mean, I think I'm trying to layer what other people have told me. And these people are, you know, CEOs, guest speakers that we've had in class, or people I've come across with my time in the military, and it all boils down to the challenge of being on the same page and achieving the same goal. And so that relationship management piece, it's really true. You know, when I was in uniform, I had to interact with different foreign nations and their militaries. And then going to UVA, it's having to interact with professors, students, staff, administration. So knowing their language and knowing how to manage relationships on all different levels, I think, has been the biggest challenge to me. And if you want me to point out a specific instance, it would probably be, you know, the time where, let's see, yeah, I had to somehow communicate to the Romanian Navy what our mission statement was, and they had a different view of what our mission was. And so we had to spend a couple more days. Mission statement, and just as like the whole Marines mission statement, or was it like something more specific? It was something more specific. We were there to, you know, train, aid, and assist ahead of their combat deployment. And so I think generally speaking, they wanted to achieve something else while we had already orders to provide a set level of instruction. And so kind of going back to the whole relationship management piece, it's, you know, seeing eye to eye on a specific situation. And really that learning curve and, you know, being on the same page was probably the biggest challenge to me because, you know, this was a high stakes situation. People are, you know, I would say, you know, tense, right? But I guess at the end of the day, I had to make them comfortable and I had to make our team comfortable for us to be able to get on the same page. Wow. Is that helpful? Do you want me to give you like a UVA example? No, no. That's, that's, I try to capture diverse stories and this is definitely very unique. So how did you, how did you resolve that challenge? Yeah. So, I mean, to start off, the specific challenges were like the language barrier, right? And then the culture that they operated in. The language part, I couldn't, couldn't really fix that. I wasn't speaking Romanian. And so instead of trying to, you know, let that gap stay there, I, you know, we found a translator. And so finding somebody who could add value into the team who can then bridge that gap. So that solved that specific challenge. And then the cultural challenge was that for some reason they like to drink, especially when we're doing training events. And this includes like, you know, doing military exercises. And so having to bargain with them that, hey, we're not going to drink right now on the range, but guess what, I, you know, the U.S. dollar is pretty strong. So I'll withdraw some Romanian money. And then after we have a successful day out on the range, I'll treat you guys out for beer. How does that sound? So it was more of like incentivizing the way that they operated as a culture, but incentivizing it to the, in a way to where, you know, it wasn't going to interfere with the objective. So it would be after the fact, it would kind of be a prize, if you will. That's funny. Yeah, they had like, they brought in like crates of, I guess it would be equivalent to, you know, just locally made whiskey. And, you know, we were like, no, this is, this can't happen out on the range right now. What do people misunderstand about being a Marine? I guess I'll share maybe some experiences that I've had at school is that, you know, people, people are typically appreciative of the fact that I serve, but I think there's an underlying misconception that, you know, that, you know, there's kind of a, I don't know, a patriotism that's embedded with it, right, because we did it voluntarily. It's not to say that I'm not patriotic and thankful for the country that I've served, but it can be a tense conversation when you're affiliated with the military, or you were at one point, and people have their preconceived notions, right, without kind of a layered understanding that I've had to, you know, grow up in. Right. That's not, that's not like specific to being a Marine. I guess that's just being a veteran. But I think, well, what might also be misunderstood is, I guess, thinking about the UVA population being 18 to 22-year-olds is that they, until I tell them and share these stories like I'm sharing now, like, it's not immediate or kind of implicit that I come in with, you know, a range of experiences. I've had to lead, you know, grown adults into, you know, foreign countries, and I've had to be responsible for their lives. And so that might be a misunderstanding, I guess, to some extent, but I think it's also kind of a bliss, ignorance, because it's not something that they've experienced, or they might have learned through family members or other people who have served. It seems the two largest misconceptions in your mind are, is that just because you serve in the military doesn't mean that you agree with every single action that the military takes, and are some sort of, like, you're wearing your Star Spangled Banner flag to class every day. And also that a lot of the stuff that you do is, are things that the average college student only sees about in movies. That's right. Yeah, that's well, well summarized. That's what I try to do here. So what is some advice, general advice that you have for students at UVA? Yeah, I think, I mean, I've brainstormed this quite a bit. I think to some respect, it would be, it would be that I think regardless of where people are coming from, including myself, everyone, everyone should imagine university or at least UVA, or going into college as like a level playing field, as in that, you know, the courses are available, right, with an asterisk, if you can get into the class, the professors are there, the resources are there. And so it's really, the advice would be that, you know, the accountability and the onus is on the individual. Yeah, I'm a firm believer in that if you really want to achieve something, you'll do everything in your power to do so. That can mean that if, you know, you want to get into finance or consulting, you don't have to be in a finance or consulting club. So with that advice, it would be to be it, it would be to, you know, find the strengths that you have, and apply those in order to not necessarily compensate, but to show others and to expose yourself to new opportunities. So again, I'm trying to be summative for you, it would be to, you know, put yourself out there, you know, set achievable goals. And then I think I'd wrap that up in a bow and say that, you know, don't compare yourself to your peers. Because what you want to achieve and what they've achieved, it could be the same, it could be different, but how you achieve it, it does not have to be the same. That's great advice. Excuse me. So what is one question that you love to be asked? Or that you love asking other people? Yeah, I think I've gotten this question before in an interview. Have you actually? Yeah, it's... That's so funny. Everyone I asked this question to, they all are like, I've never heard that question before. And it's the first time I've heard anyone say that they've heard it, which makes me happy that someone else out there has thought of this question. Yeah, I mean, it certainly requires somebody to reflect, right? Stop on my feet, if you will. But I'm thinking of another question that I was, I was asked in an interview. And then I think after it was some funeral for a friend, and it was it, the conversation ended up these, these two instances, kind of yielded the same question at one point and it was, tell me about your soul. And the two times that I've been asked that question have just been ingrained in my mind, because those are really the times that I've had to reflect on who I am and what I value and who I do it for. So, you know, going back to the question, it would be, yeah, when somebody asks, you know, when somebody has asked me about who I am and what, you know, asked me to tell them about my soul. It's just kind of a transformative question in itself. Wow, I don't even know how I'd answer that. Exactly. That's a good one. I've never heard that one. So that, that is great. And now this is sort of a more fun question of what's, what was your favorite UVA memory? Oh, well, I, you know, it's still fresh in my head. But I would say walking along during graduation, I think that whole day and that whole weekend is just encapsulated my UVA experience, all the, everything from, you know, grabbing your cords, grabbing your stoles, you know, taking photos, going to the bar super early, and then walking alongside your friends and everyone is so happy and rejoicing in the moment that it, there's, I, it's, there's nothing else that can replicate it. I got that, that, I got that coming up in, in May. Yeah. So I'm looking forward to it. Yeah. I'm sure. Yeah. I mean, it, it's an amazing experience. And I'd add to that, like, it's not only just the students and your friends that, you know, you're seeing throughout the day, throughout the night, throughout the weekend, but you get to see your professors, like we were, I was taking selfies with my finance, private equity professor. And, you know, we were, we were talking to each other, like, Hey, we, we made it, like, obviously they're there to stay, but I'm, I'm going to go, go out into the real world now. That's awesome. Well, this was, this was super helpful. I really appreciate the interview. You gave a lot of really good answers. And I think a lot of students, even if they've never thought about the military once in their life will, will get a lot from it. Yeah, I appreciate it. And you know, to add to that, like you mentioned in the beginning, like being involved in communities, like it wasn't just the veteran population that I was a part of. It was also the people who were in ROTC, people who were on the fence about, you know, thinking about commissioning or joining the military that I, you know, would go on and mentor and tell them, tell them the stories about when I was an instructor at OCS and the basic school. And so I have a lot of fond memories about sharing my military experience for those who inquire it, because, you know, I think knowledge at the end of the day is power and it's worth nothing if you don't share it. I 100% agree.
